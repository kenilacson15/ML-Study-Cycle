# ML-Study-Cycle

This repository is my comprehensive study cycle covering all the basics and fundamentals of machine learning. I created it to track my learning and knowledge publicly, and to strengthen my understanding of both the mathematical foundations (such as linear algebra and calculus) and the core concepts of machine learning. Here, I share hands-on experience with algorithms, practical coding exercises, and my personal notes as I progress.

**Note:** The main objective of this study cycle is to sharpen my knowledge in machine learning using Python. This repository is not intended for building large-scale projects or deployment-level machine learning systems. For my bigger projects and production-ready ML work, please refer to my other repositories on GitHub. This study cycle is focused on learning, practice, and mastering the fundamentals.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Mathematical Foundations:** Linear algebra, calculus, and statistics essential for ML.
- **Core Machine Learning Concepts:** Step-by-step implementations of algorithms like linear regression, gradient descent, and more.
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **Python Code Examples:** Well-commented scripts using libraries such as NumPy for easy learning and experimentation.
- **Practical Exercises:** Code and explanations to reinforce learning and build intuition.

## Who Is This For?
This study cycle is ideal for beginners and anyone looking to solidify their understanding of machine learning fundamentals, both in theory and practice. I hope my journey and notes can help others as well.

## Example Topics Covered
- Vector and matrix operations
- Linear regression from scratch
- Gradient descent optimization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment (coming soon)

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Explore the code files in the `linear-algebra/` directory and beyond.
3. Run the scripts, read the comments, and modify the code to deepen your understanding.

## Getting Started
To run the code examples, make sure you have Python and NumPy installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install dependencies with:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
pip install numpy
```
