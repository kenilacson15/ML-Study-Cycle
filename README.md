# 📘 ML Study Cycle

Welcome to my **ML Study Cycle** — a structured, personal roadmap covering the **fundamentals of machine learning** using Python.

This repository is where I publicly track my learning journey, deepen my understanding of **mathematical foundations** (like linear algebra and calculus), and implement core **machine learning concepts** from scratch. Along the way, I share **well-documented code**, **hands-on exercises**, and **practical notes**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repo is focused purely on learning, prototyping, and reinforcing foundational concepts. For full-scale projects and production-ready ML systems, check out my other repositories.
